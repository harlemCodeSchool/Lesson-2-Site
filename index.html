		<h2>Javascript and the DOM</h2>	
		<p> Now that we've rolling with HTML and CSS, it's time to 
			start using javascript. Possibly the most powerful feature 
			of js is it's ability to manipulate HTML and CSS. 
		</p>

		<h3>Targeting Elements</h3>	
		<p> Let's target an element that already exists. Right below
			this print is a div element with an id of 'jsTarget'.
			We will leave it blank with HTML and CSS and use js
			to control that stuff!
		</p>
		<i>You can copy paste all this code into your script.js
			file anywhere inside the curly braces of the main 
			function.
		</i>

		<div class="targeting-wrap">
			<h4> Turn '#jsTarget' into a rectangle with js:</h4>
			<p><code><div>
				var targetMyDiv = document.getElementById('jsTarget');
				<br>
				var styleDiv = targetMyDiv.style;
				<br>
				<br>
				styleDiv.width = ('200px');
				<br>
				styleDiv.height = ('100px');
				<br>
				styleDiv.border = ('3px solid red');
				<br>
				styleDiv.backgroundColor = ('forestgreen');
			</div></code></p>

			<strong>And here's the result!: </strong>

			<div id="jsTarget"></div>
			<div class="targeting-sidebar">
			<!-- Using a <p> tag each line because I'm using the '<' character -->
				<h4> Code breakdown </h4>
				<p> <<< Target element on the document w/id of 'jsTarget'</p>
				<p> <<< Make styleDiv = the style function on</p>
				<p>'jsTarget', which we targeted with </p>
				<p> the variable targetMyDiv</p>
				<p> <<< Now set the width to 300px</p>
				<p> <<< Now set the height to 200px</p>
				<p> <<< Make the border solid, 2px and red</p>
				<p> <<< Background color of forest-green</p>

			</div>

		<p> Here's what we did: we made an empty div with html
				and we used javascript to style it. We could have done
				it with CSS, and eventually mixing the two is the best
				way to achieve things in the browser.

	  <strong> Now let's make an html element with javascript
	  		    and append it to another element.
